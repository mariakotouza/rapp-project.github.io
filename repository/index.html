                    <p class="large text-muted">The RAPP project provides an open-source software platform to support the creation and delivery of Robotic Applications (RApps), which, in turn, are expected to increase the versatility and utility of robots. These applications enable robots to provide physical assistance to people at risk of exclusion, especially the elderly, to function as a companion or to adopt the role of a friendly tutor for people who want to partake in the electronic feast but donâ€™t know where to start.</p>

                   <p class="large text-muted">RAPP has created a Repository, also known as RAPP Store, which  is a website that hosts a collection of RApps (Robotic Applications) which may be downloaded by RAPP users on their robots. Both Developers and Robot Users need to create an account and log in to the RAPP store in an authenticated manner.</p> 
                   <p class="large text-muted">Developers submit the source code of the RApps they developed to the RAPP store where they are compiled and an executable package is created (if needed, depending on the development language). RApp-related information like compatibility with certain robot models and their respective software and firmware versions, dependencies on other RApps etc. are stored in the Centralized DB on the platform side and are accessible by the RAPP Store. The database also holds the log in and the general information of both Developers and Robot Users. In the RAPP store website, a list of the available robots and their capabilities can be retrieved from the centralized DB and be accessible to potential developers to help them develop their RApps.</p>
                   <p class="large text-muted">The compilation process of a new RApp begins with the developer submitting the source code and any required dependencies and then follows a RApp packaging process which is executed in the RAPP Store. A Robotic Application can be submitted as pure C++ code, a ROS package (using C++ or Python) and pure JS code.</p>
