The “In-house Risk Detection” scenario: an experimentation room mimicking a home environment has been created, detecting hazards in the house like doors and windows left open and electrical devices forgotten switched on, aiming to enhance the independent living of the elderly targeting for their safety. </p> 
                   <p class="large text-muted">2. The “Passing Information group of functions” scenario: applications that will be developed to assist elderly connecting with family and friends through Skype calls and emails, to follow their medication routine, to be reminded for special events or dates like family birthdays, to create their own memory ball with all those memories they like to treasure like photos, favourite songs etc. and reproduce them at any time they want, as well as to enhance their attention through cognitive games. </p>
