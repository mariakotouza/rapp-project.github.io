                    <p class="large text-muted text-center">The RAPP project provides an open-source software platform to support the creation and delivery of Robotic Applications (RApps), which, in turn, are expected to increase the versatility and utility of robots. These applications enable robots to provide physical assistance to people at risk of exclusion, especially the elderly, to function as a companion or to adopt the role of a friendly tutor for people who want to partake in the electronic feast but don’t know where to start.</p>

                   <p class="large text-muted">On the cloud resides the RAPP Improvement Centre (RIC) which can perform a variety of Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) tasks, either when requested by a RApp, or as a standalone or offline process. Other than the streamlined services provided by RIC, in the cloud also resides a workspace where specific tasks programmed by the developer of a RApp can be executed. This serves as a high performance computing entity (in comparison to the robot) where computationally expensive processes of a RApp that are not already offered as a service from the RIC can be offloaded.</p>
                   <p class="large text-muted">The overall RAPP architecture is presented on the right. There are two major layers, further divided into subcomponents and specific systems. The two layers are the RAPP platform (located on the cloud infrastructure) and the Robot platform (located at the software level of each robot participating in the RAPP framework). The particular subsystems shown below correspond to the major high-level components that are expected on each layer; the RAPP Store, the RAPP Improvement Centerand the RApp execution workspace (Cloud Agent) on the cloud side, and the Core and Dynamic Agents as well as the Communication Layer on the robot side.</p>
